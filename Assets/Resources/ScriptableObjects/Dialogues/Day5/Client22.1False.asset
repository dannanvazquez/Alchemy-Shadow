  _dialogueText: HEY YOU! I heard Bruce came by some days ago. I'm having trouble
    putting things in words. But thanks for not serving him. He's Marmie and I's
    grandson. I don't know what go in to him, but he was planning on hurting Marmie.
    Hurting her really bad. I heard your business is in trouble, but you still decided
    against serving someone. Because you know it wasn't right. Thank you.
