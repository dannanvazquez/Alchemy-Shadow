  _dialogueText: Hello. I'm having a lot of trouble understanding myself... I've
    been acting irrationally and I just cannot seem to understand why or how it's
    happening. All I know is I had finally worked up the courage to tell my husband
    he needs to pull his weight but somehow I cannot seem to make any argument for
    it. I want to ask him to take a listening potion or something.
