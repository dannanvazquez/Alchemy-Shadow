  _dialogueText: No matter what I do. I just cannot seem to stay up. I just feel
    so sick. I'm always falling asleep way earlier than I usually do. My partner's
    and I's anniversary is coming up and I've been trying to sneakily order some
    things. But looking through the different websites ethical statement and then
    fact checking all of them takes time. Any chance you have something REALLY STRONG
    to help with that?
