  _dialogueText: My partner's and I's anniversary is coming up and I've been trying
    to sneakily order some things. He seems to think because I never buy him things
    that I don't care but looking through the different ethical statements of the
    different shops along with then fact checking all of them takes time. But I love
    him, I really do.
